# SuperBands Indicator

SuperBands is a reliable Forex indicator for trend analysis. It calculates upper and lower bands based on the High and Low prices of each bar. When the closing price falls below the lower band, it indicates a buying opportunity.

## Indicator Initialization

In the `OnInit()` function, the indicator buffers are mapped and the main indicator line is set. The indicator style and label are also set.

## Indicator Calculation

In the `OnCalculate()` function, the number of bars to calculate and recalculate is checked. The indicator values are then calculated for each bar. The upper and lower bands are calculated using the High and Low prices, and the indicator value is set to the closing price. If the closing price falls below the lower band, a buying trade is executed.

## Buying Trade Execution

The `BuyTrade()` function is called when a buying opportunity is identified. This function is where you can implement your own buying trade execution logic, such as sending a buy order to your broker.
